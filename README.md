# Standardize_Purchase

Standardized Purchase is a Python program designed to demonstrate the effect of standardization scaling on classification models such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees. The program visualizes the results using scatter plots and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots.

## Features

- Standardization Scaling: Applies standardization to dataset features to ensure they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- Logistic Regression: Implements logistic regression for classification tasks.
- Decision Tree: Uses a decision tree classifier to compare performance.

## Visualization:

- Scatter plots to illustrate model decision boundaries.
- KDE plots to analyze data distributions.

## Prerequisites

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
